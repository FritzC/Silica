<qqueue> ah. well it turns out that that all the metadata on madokami is in fact scraped directly from mangaupdates
<NA-45> really?
<NA-45> awesome, that makes it easier
<NA-45> thank you very much
<qqueue> yeah, source code for the website is https://github.com/qqueue/MangaIndex/blob/master/app/lib/MangaUpdates.php
<qqueue> I can give you a dump of the database, which will give you madokami dir -> MU id
<NA-45> that would be awesome
<qqueue> sure, give me a few minutes to figure out a query
<NA-45> thanks so much
<qqueue> i'm curious, what exactly are you doing with your mirror anyway? personal database thing?
<NA-45> pretty much
<NA-45> making myself an archive app
<NA-45> that will let me do some advanced sorting and managing
<NA-45> tied in with my mangaupdates and mal accounts
<qqueue> cool
<NA-45> and will let me pipe to my android devices
<NA-45> through local network
<qqueue> I made you an rsync account: user: na45, pass: aihighushaej7Thoo4yaep9wahzeatho
<NA-45> thanks
<qqueue> usage is roughly http://pastebin.com/dUbPQNQD
<qqueue> if you do stick it in cron or whatever, make sure to use flock to prevent concurrent syncs
<NA-45> alright
<NA-45> thanks again, helps out a lot
<qqueue> ok, you can hit https://manga.madokami.al/stupidapi/muids to get a TSV from path to -> mu id
<qqueue> it's a dumb cgi script, so don't abuse it too often
<NA-45> alright will do
<NA-45> thanks again, helps me out a ton
<qqueue> no prob
